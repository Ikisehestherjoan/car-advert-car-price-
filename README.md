# Python Analysis Case Study: Car Sale Adverts

## Overview

This Python analysis case study focuses on analyzing a dataset of car sale adverts, which contains anonymized information about vehicles, including brand, type, color, mileage, and selling price. The goal of this project is to consolidate the knowledge gained from the "Principles of Data Science" unit by addressing a practical data science problem. This case study covers typical tasks in data understanding, exploration, data preparation, and identifying or hypothesizing interesting associations and group differences within the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains a collection of anonymized car sale adverts. It includes various attributes related to vehicles such as brand, type, color, mileage, and selling price. This dataset is a real-world representation of car sale listings and is a valuable resource for practicing data science and analysis.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this case study are as follows:

- To gain insights into the factors that influence car prices.
- To identify patterns and trends in the car sale adverts.
- To explore relationships between different attributes and the selling price of cars.
- To apply various data science techniques and tools to solve practical problems.

## Data Understanding

In this phase, we aim to understand the structure and contents of the dataset. We explore the data to get a sense of its size, the types of attributes present, and their meanings. This is a crucial first step before diving into any analysis.

## Data Exploration

Data exploration involves investigating the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships between variables. We will create visualizations and summary statistics to better understand the data. This phase will provide valuable insights into the car sale adverts dataset.

## Data Preparation

Data preparation involves cleaning, transforming, and pre-processing the data to make it suitable for analysis. This step ensures that the dataset is in a form that can be used effectively to answer the research questions.

## Hypotheses and Associations

In this phase, we will formulate hypotheses and explore associations and group differences in the data. We might test hypotheses such as:

- Does the car brand significantly impact the selling price?
- Is there a correlation between mileage and selling price?
- Are there any trends in car color preferences that affect the price?

By addressing these questions, we aim to provide meaningful insights into the factors that influence car prices.

## Conclusion

The ultimate goal of this case study is to draw conclusions and insights from the analysis of the car sale adverts dataset.
